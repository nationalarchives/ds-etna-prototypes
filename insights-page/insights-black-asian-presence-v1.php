                    <h2>Introduction: Arriving in Britain</h2>
                    <p>
                        People of African and Asian origin have lived in Britain for at least two millennia. They arrived here many hundreds of years
                        before the massive forced migrations sparked by the slave trade and the British colonisation of India. And by the time the SS
                        Windrush arrived in 1948, famously carrying the first postwar arrivals from the Caribbean, Britain had a firmly established
                        Black and Asian population.

                                <p>
                                    Between 1678 and 1682, Jean Barbot, a French commercial agent, traded for gold along the Gold Coast (now Ghana),
                                    in West Africa. This drawing is taken from his journals, held by The National Archives. In his journals, among a variety
                                    of observations on African life, Barbot describes how gold is mined. Methods used include panning for gold dust and,
                                    as shown here, diving for nuggets in the local rivers. Intriguingly, and despite his having first-hand knowledge of the
                                    area, both Barbot’s report on gold mining and his drawing rely on material in other sources. This drawing, for example,
                                    almost entirely reproduces the one in an earlier work by Olfert Dapper, a Dutch scholar who had never even visited
                                    Africa.

                    <h2>Why Asian and Black History?</h2>
                    <p>
                        There were many Asian and Black people living in Britain throughout the period covered by this exhibition (1500-1850).

                        It is often assumed that the population of Britain was entirely White at this period. How many people know, for example,
                        that one of the leaders of the radical Chartist movement, which fought for the vote in the 19th century, was Black?
                        Or that Elizabeth I tried to expel a number of Black people from England? Or that thousands of Black men, and probably
                        even a few Black women, fought in the British army and navy during the Napoleonic Wars?

                    <h2>What Do We Know?</h2>
                    <p>
                        There is much historical evidence about Black people in Britain, and this exhibition explores some of it. But many subjects
                        have not been researched, and there is much that we still do not know.

                    <h2>Early Migrations</h2>
                    <p>
                        In Roman times, Black troops were sent to the remote and barbaric province of Britannia, and some of them stayed when
                        the Roman legions left Britain. Later on, in the Middle Ages, Moors arrived in Britain. They probably came, directly or
                        indirectly, from Spain, which had been conquered by Muslims from North and Northwest Africa in the 8th century.

                            Although the British government tried several times to get rid of groups of Black people, there was clearly a settled
                            Black and Asian population here throughout the period 1500-1850.

                    <p>
                        British involvement in the slave trade began in the 16th century and had reached huge proportions by the 18th. Over a period
                        of 400 years, Europeans transported many millions of Africans to labour in their colonies in the Americas. These migrations
                        created the Black diaspora.

                        Here, they were not necessarily treated significantly more humanely than they were on the plantations and their legal status
                        (‘free’ or ‘enslaved’) was extensively argued in a series of court cases.

                                    This image, from the Gentleman's Magazine, shows Ayuba Suleiman Diallo (here called by the English version of his
                                    name, Job ben Solomon), the son of a Muslim imam from Gambia, and William Ansah Sessarakoo, a prince from Ghana.
                                    They were both tricked into slavery, but freed on account of their noble origins and education. Sessarakoo lived in
                                    England from 1749 to 1750.

                                    Solomon travelled to England after spending time on a plantation in Maryland. He became something of a celebrity
                                    and was 'graciously received by nobility'. Dressed in an African gown, he was presented to the king and queen. After
                                    spending some time in England, he was taken back to Africa by the Royal African Company.
